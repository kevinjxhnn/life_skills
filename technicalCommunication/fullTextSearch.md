# Full Text Search 

To improve our project's performance and scalability, I've been investigating different database options for full-text search. Our team has been struggling with performance problems, and our team lead suggested exploring Elasticsearch, Solr, and Lucene as potential solutions to enhance our efficiency. I have provided a small brief on the topics mentioned below.


### 1. Lucene
Lucene is a Java-based, open-source full-text search library that serves as the foundation for building custom search solutions. It provides core search functionality and requires development effort to implement. Lucene is highly flexible, making it suitable for custom applications, but its scalability depends on the specific architecture.

### 2. Solr
Solr is an open-source search platform built on Lucene. It is designed for enterprise use, offering a range of advanced features. Solr is highly flexible and configurable, making it suitable for various search use cases. It excels in scalability, capable of efficiently handling large datasets and complex search requirements.

### 3. Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is an distributed search and analytics engine built on Lucene. It is ideal for real-time, distributed search and analytics use cases. Elasticsearch offers a rich set of features, including real-time indexing and analytics, and provides a user-friendly REST API for easy integration. It is highly flexible and excels in scalability, making it a popular choice for real-time data analysis, such as log and event data.

In summary, Lucene is the core search library, Solr is a search server built on top of Lucene, and Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine. The choice between them depends on your specific use case and requirements. Lucene requires more development effort, Solr offers a balance between flexibility and features, and Elasticsearch is a powerful, scalable solution for real-time search and analytics.
